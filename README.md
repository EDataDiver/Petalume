## Time series model with candle and home goods sales
Sales data from a retailer of candles and home goods over 18 months were used to explore time series model creation. This code uses time series anaylsis to identify trends and systemic patterns over time, including seasonal variations, cyclic fluctuations, as well as irregular variations. The model is also used to predict future sales.
