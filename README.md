Candle and home goods sales
Data from sales of candles and home goods over a year and a half were used to explore time series model creation. This code uses time series anaylsis to identify trends and systemic patterns over time, including seasonal variations, cyclic fluctuations, as well as irregular variations. The model is also used to predict future sales.
